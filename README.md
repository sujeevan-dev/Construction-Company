# Construction-Company

This is the first website I created from the ground-up. First I created the wirefram using PhotoShop getting inspiration from a few sites I came across in Pinterest. I took different sections form three different websites and also added my creativigty into it. For the first time I applied CSS flexbox grid sytstem alogn with CSSSvariables. Its amazing that CSS is getting better day by day.
